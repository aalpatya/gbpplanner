## Initial Setup
Install Raylib dependencies as mentioned in https://github.com/raysan5/raylib#build-and-installation.
This will be platform dependent. For raylib itself, the CMakeLists.txt file should automatically find the library if it is already installed on your system, else, it will try and fetch it using FetchContent.

Usually included with Linux (but you may need to install on other platforms)
- [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/)
- cmake (>=3.11)
- make

Clone the repository *with the submodule dependencies:*
```shell
git clone https://github.com/aalpatya/gbpplanner.git
cd gbpplanner
```
Use CMAKE to set up the build environment and then run 'make':
```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Run examples
Make any changes to the simulations you want in config/config.json and then run:
```shell
./gbpplanner
```

Examples config files are in config directory, and include:
- ```config.json``` (default: robots travel to the opposite sides of a circle in free space)
- ```circle_cluttered.json``` (robots travel to the opposite sides of a circle around some obstacles)
- ```junction.json``` (robots travel in a crossroad junction)
- ```junction_twoway.json``` (robots can travel in both directions, in any road and can turn left, straight, right (red, green, blue) respectively)

Run the simulation:
```shell
./gbpplanner --cfg ../config/circle_cluttered.json
```

Or create your own config_file.json and run:
```shell
./gbpplanner --cfg ../config_file.json
```

### During simulation
**Press 'H' to display help and tips!**

Use the mouse wheel to change the camera view (scroll : zoom, drag : pan, shift+drag : rotate)

Press 'spacebar' to transition between camera keyframes which were set in ```src/Graphics.cpp```.

## Play with the code
Edit the parameters in the config files and see the effects on the simulations!

### Own formations
You may want to create your own formations and scenarios for the robots.

Towards the end of ```src/Simulator.cpp``` there is a function called ```createOrDeleteRobots()```, where you may add your own case.

### Custom Obstacles
- Create an image file (.png) with BLACK obstacles on a WHITE background (see ```assets/imgs``` for examples)
- Covert your image to a distance field image using the function in ```assets/scripts/create_distance_field.py```
- Edit the OBSTACLE_FILE value in your config.json file with the new distance image
